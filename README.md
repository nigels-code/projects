I wrote this while following Maximilian Schwarzmuller's "Understanding Typescript" course.

Technologies used: Typescript, HTML, CSS.

I have set up a CI/CD pipeline between Github and Netlify.  
Open <https://projectsxx.netlify.app/> to see this project in production.

## Installation
```sh
npm install
```
## Usage
```sh
npm start
```
This runs the application in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view it in a browser.
